    "What makes markdown different to say, just writing in a text file, or writing in a word processor, or writing a web page in HTML?\n",
    "\n",
    "The key features of markdown are:\n",
    "\n",
    " - You just write text! There are no formatting menus like you would see in a word processor.\n",
    " - You can add formatting with special characters. For example to make something bold surround it with __\\_\\_double underscores\\_\\____\n",
    " - When markdown is *rendered* it gets converted to something that displays nicely, and the special characters get converted to ___formatted text___.\n",
    " - But even when it's not formatted it's still very readable, if not *quite* as pretty. This is different to HTML, which supports all kinds of formatting options, but is more or less unreadable when viewed in its raw form.\n",
    " \n",
    "This makes Markdown easy to use in multiple settings - to store alongside your code for quick reading, and incorporate into your shiny documentation in it's final rendered format without having to copy paste and add extra formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Places you'll see markdown used (that you might be familiar with already.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Many chat clients (e.g. Slack, Discord)\n",
    " - Confluence supports writing in markdown\n",
    " - Github supports writing documents like README files in markdown to be rendered as html when you browse your repository on github.\n",
    " - Jupyter Notebooks have markdown cells that automatically rendered when you run them!"
