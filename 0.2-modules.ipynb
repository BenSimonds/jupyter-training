    "## A bit about Packages and pip.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Packages** in python are a way of distributing a collection of one or more **modules**. At its simplest a package can just be a folder with a few simple python files in it. In daily use you'll more often see packages distributed with pythons built in package manager *pip*. Pip is installed with python and gives you access to download packages from the [python package index](https://pypi.org/). In enterprise settings it might be a bit complex than this, and you might use pip or another tool to download packages from a different repository, but the end result is the same - pip will download the package and install somewhere in your environment where python knows how to access it (where exactly depends on how you tell pip to install it and how your python environment is configured.\n",
